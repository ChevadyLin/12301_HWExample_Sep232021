------Recommendation--------  
Don't go directly into the example code.
I would recommend the do things in the following order:
1. Try one pir sensor and one led. Learn to light up the led by triggering the pir sensor.
2. Try lighting up multiple leds once.
3. Try lighting up multiple leds when the pir sensor is triggered.
4. Teach yourself how to use random() function.
5. How to send high voltage to the pin corresponding to the number generated by random().

With all above, you should be able to smoothly finish this HW.
